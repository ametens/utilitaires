## Scripts

[**dfy.py**](https://github.com/ametens/utilitaires/blob/0311ab4f54152793b43c91cda654074fc8d12e1c/dfy.py)

Is a script based on the excellent Youtube module ([pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/api.html)).  
Simply paste a playlist url from Y o u t u b e and download all the audio files in mp4 format, from this source.

Great to store the file on your hard drive in case of a cut of Internet connection...
