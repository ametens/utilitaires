Some ideas, utilities to work with python

## Script

**dfy.py**

Is a script based on the excellent Youtube module ([pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/api.html)) and the interface maker for python called (PySimpleGUI).  It allows to paste a playlist url from Youtube and download in mp4 format all the audio files from this one.

Great to store the file on your hard drive in case of a cut of Internet connection...
